					Regular expressions
					automata builder and
					string matcher

This program is a fully functional regex implementation based on nondeterministic finite automatas.
However, some things have to be added, removed or fixed in order to provide (see the list in
TODO):
- NFA graphs
- other forms of user input than CLI parameters (reading files)
- precompiled NFA storing in files
- operator priority adjusting.

Another note on the latter: "|" has the same priority as concatenation (not visible), so
"ab|c" will be transformed into "ab[CONCAT]c|" instead of "abc|[CONCAT]", so
instead of allowing only strings { "ab", "ac" } the automata will allow only { "ab", "c" }.
Please, explicitly place "()" around each "|" usage, providing either
"a(b|c)" or "(ab)|c"!
This is applicable to any prospective binar operations, I just do not have any now.
